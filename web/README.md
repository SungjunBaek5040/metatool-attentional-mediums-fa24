## Fork repository
From [https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks]:
- Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository, also known as the "upstream" repository. After you fork a repository, you can fetch updates from the upstream repository to keep your fork up to date, and you can propose changes from your fork to the upstream repository with pull requests. A fork can exist in either a personal account or an organization.

(Detailed tutorial [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo?tool=webui))
- Fork repository by clicking on the `Fork` button.
- Follow the UI and click `Create fork`.
- In your forked repository, click the `Code` button. Navigate to `Open with Github Desktop`.
- Github Desktop should open.
- Click: `Open the repository in your existing editor`.

## Open in VSCode and use Live Server to preview webpage

- Once the repository opens, copy the folder `dan__copy_me_and_rename` and name it with your own name.
- Open `1_hello_world.html`.
- Click to Go Live from the status bar to turn the webserver on/off.
- ![screenshot of go live](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server/raw/HEAD/images/Screenshot/vscode-live-server-statusbar-3.jpg)
- By default, the server should be at [https://127.0.0.1:5500/].

## Challenges

- Each web page is meant to be a brief crash course / tutorial. Some of them contain challenges or deliberately broken elements. Please open each one and complete it!

## Submit a pull request

When you're done, please submit a pull request! A 'pull request' proposes changes to the parent or 'upstream' repository from your forked repo.
- Follow the following steps: [https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork]
